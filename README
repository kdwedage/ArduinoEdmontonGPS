Included Files:

-/server:
    server.cpp 
        - Handle Arduino serial request for points on the edmonton map,
        and determines shorts manhantann path to destination, and 
        sends back waypoints.
        - Referenced Dijkstra.cpp file from eclass, for determining
        shortest path based on search tree.
    digraph.cpp 
        -From eclass, provides class for directed graph, unmodified.
    digraph.h
        -From eclass, unmodified.
    wdigraph.h
        -From eclass, provides class for weighted graph, unmodified.
    dijkstra.cpp 
        - Dijkstra algorithm implementation using binary heap and weighted graph.
        - Based on eclass dijkstra algorithm 3 from heap slides.
    dijkstra.h
    heap.h 
        - Implementation of Binary heap using min heap property.
        - Modified from eclass.
    serialport.cpp
        -Simplifies serial communication.
        -From eclass, unmodified.
    serialport.h
        -From eclass, unmodified.
    edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt
        -Text file containing vertexes and edges corresponding to locations
        on an Edmonton map.
        -From eclass, unmodified.
    Makefile
-/client
    -client.cpp
        -Using a tft display, displays an Edmonton map. Allows for navigation
        using a joystick, and buttons for zooming in and out. User is able
        to select a start location and an end location, and when the complementary
        server is running, then the shortest path will be drawn on the display.
        -Based off eclass client base code.
    -const_and_types.h
        -Contains contsants and types relevant to the display, and coordinates.
        -Modified to include serial buffer max length, and max way_points.
        -From eclass.
    -lcd_image.cpp
        -Used for drawing images to the LCD.
        -From eclass, unmodified.
    -lcd_image.h
        -From eclass, unmodified.
    -map_drawing.cpp
        -Used for simplifing common map related tasks.
        -From eclass, unmodified.
    -map_drawing.h
        -From eclass, unmodified.
    -circuit-wiring.txt
        -Wiring for the Arduino, to correctly use the client side code.
        -From eclass, unmodified.
    -Makefile
        -From eclass, unmodified
-README

Running Instructions:
    
    Navigate to server folder containing the server.cpp file.
    To build object files, link object files run the command:
        make
    To just build object files:
        make server.o
    or
        make dijkstra.o
    or
        make digraph.o
    or
        make serialport.o
    To remove all created files:
        make clean

    Then connect the Arduino Mega by Serial to the computer. Make sure the port selected is 'ttyACM0'. 

    Navigate to client folder, containing the client.cpp file.
    Run the command:
        make upload

    Then on the computer, navigate to the folder containing the ./server file,
    then run the command:

    ./server

    If required, restart the arduino. Then proceed to select locations on the arduino, using the joystick and joystick button, and recieving the shortest distance from the initial location to the final location.

    Some locations will not be reachable, and therefore will not display a result on the arduino. 

Assumptions:
    That all the required files are included. The circuit is wired correctly, based on the circuit-wiring.txt file. 

    No other terminal windows are opened running serial, or trying to access port 'ttyACM0'.
